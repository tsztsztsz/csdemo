 * than any functional change in the STM itself. It allows
 * conversion of the output TS packets from raw binary

 * The frequency of sync generation will be handled in
 * hardware but its behaviour is somewhat undefined. By
 * starting trace you will get an ASYNC packet, but we
 * want it to be regular in case our output buffer wraps.
 *
 * By giving these values we get more predictable trace
